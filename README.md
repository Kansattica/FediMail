# FediMail
## *It's Like Email*

FediMail is a C# program that aims to let you use that original decentralized federated social network, email, to post on the fediverse using [msync](https://github.com/Kansattica/msync), because I wrote it and I like it and I think it has some useful features.

It's pretty bare-bones right now, but I'm working on it.
